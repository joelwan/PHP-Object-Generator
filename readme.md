# PHP Object Generator

PHP Object Generator, (POG) is an open source PHP code generator which automatically generates 
clean & tested Object Oriented code for your PHP4/PHP5 application. 

Over the years, we realized that a large portion of a PHP programmer's time is wasted on 
repetitive coding of the Database Access Layer of an application simply because 
different applications require different objects. 

By generating PHP objects with integrated CRUD methods, POG gives you a head start in any project. 

The time you save can be spent on more interesting areas of your project.
